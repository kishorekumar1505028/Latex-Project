As we can see from above, it is \textbf{clearly} better to use a binary heap 
to implement a priority queue than an array or a linked list because 
of the reduced worst case time complexity to find the element with the highest priority.

Also, Binary Heaps are represented as arrays in codes, so it is not that 
difficult to write codes using Binary Heaps.
