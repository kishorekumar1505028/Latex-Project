\begin{itemize}
    \item At line 2, we simply increment the size of heap.
    \item At Line 3, we simply insert at the last index a new node with a key of $- \infty$. 
    \item At line 4, we call the Heap-Increase-Key on the new index i.e. at the $\textit{heap-size[A]}$ , and our $newKey$ is the $key$ of the argument of this function.
    \item This function has the same time complexity as of Heap-Increase-Key which as found previously was at worst case $O(log n)$ if we were to go to the root.
\end{itemize}
