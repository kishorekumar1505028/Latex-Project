\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Function{Heap-Maximum}{A}
    
        \State
        \textbf{return} $A[1]$
    \EndFunction
         \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The function just returns the root element of Heap and since it is 
a max heap, the root element is the element with the highest priority.

This function takes $O(1)$ time.
