Since it is an interface, we must implement it using basic data structures.
\subsection{Implementing Using Array}
First obvious choice comes to mind is array.
If we implement it with an array, the problem comes in ExtractMax or ExtractMin function because every time we have to search the \textbf{whole} array to find the element with the highest or lowest priority. This linear searching is very expensive in array and at worst case will take the time of $O(n)$ time. Insertion and removal of elements is also expensive if we shift elements of array. 
\subsection{Implementation Using Linked List}
Using Linked List may solve the problem for Insertion and removal but the linear search problem will still exist and ExtractMax or ExtractMin may take a maximum of $O(n)$ time.
\subsection{A Better Alternative}
If we had a data structure that can ensure ExtractMax or ExtractMin functions occur in less than $O(n)$ time, it would be efficient to use that. Fortunately there exists such data structure and it is called \textbf{Binary Heap}.
