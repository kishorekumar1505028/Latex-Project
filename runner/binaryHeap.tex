Let us do a quick recap of a tree and a binary tree.

\subsection{Tree}
A \textbf{tree} data structure can be defined as a \textbf{collection of nodes} (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to its children nodes.

\subsection{Binary Tree}
A complete binary tree is a tree in which \textbf{every node} other than the leaves has two children. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which \textbf{every level}, except possibly the last, is \textbf{completely filled}, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

\subsection{Binary Heap}
A binary heap is an array that can be thought of as a \textbf{complete binary tree} which satisfies the \textbf{heap ordering property}.


The heap ordering property can be of two types as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Min Heap Property}: Root node has the minimum priority. Each node has a priority smaller than or equal to both of its children. Each sub-trees are also Min Heaps. If this property is satisfied, that heap is Min Heap.
    \item \textbf{Max Heap Property}: Root node has the maximum priority. Each node has a priority greater than or equal to both of its children. Each sub-trees are also Max Heaps. If this property is satisfied, that heap is Max Heap.
\end{enumerate}
