\begin{itemize}
\item This is not a Max Heap since root is not the one with the highest priority.
\item So, Max\textunderscore Heapify(A, 1) is called.
\item For first iteration, $i$ = 1, $l$ = $2*i$ = 2, $r$ = $2*i + 1$ = 3.
\item First we compare the key/priority of node at index $i$, and its left child $l$.
\item Since 4 $<$ 14, $largest$ $\gets$ $l$ , so $largest$ = 2.
\item We compare $largest$ with $r$, since 14 > 7 so $largest$ is still $l$ = 2.
\item So we must replace node at $i$ = 1, with node at $largest$ = 2, i.e. the nodes 4 and 14.

\end{itemize}
