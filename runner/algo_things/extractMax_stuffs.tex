    \begin{itemize}
        \item The lines 2 to 3 just check if the heap is empty or not.
        \item The lines 4 to 6 store the maximum value in a temporary variable   \textit{max}, replaces the root with the last element ( the element with  the lowest priority ) and decrements the size of the heap.
        \item The line 7 calls the function Max\textunderscore Heapify at the root which restores the heap property of the heap.
        \item This function has the time complexity same as the time complexity of the function Max\textunderscore Heapify since all other lines above are 
        executed at $O(1)$ time.
        \item Previously we found out that Max\textunderscore Heapify takes at worst case $O(log n)$ time, so the function ExtractMax also takes $O(log n)$ time at worst case.
